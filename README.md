A Zombie Shooter 3D game made in Processing.

#### Difficulty Level:  medium / hard  
  
The game is about standing in one place and zombies spawn all around you and come towards you. These zombies die from one bullet.
You have 30 BULLETS in your gun and if you want TO RELOAD it, you can do it by PRESSING THE "R" button. The reload takes 3 seconds.
You have to hold out for 80 seconds and then the rescue helicopter comes to your location and picks you up with a rope ladder. This is how you can win this game.
